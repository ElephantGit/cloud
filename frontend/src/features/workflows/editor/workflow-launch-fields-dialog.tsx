/**
 * Declares which launch fields the `@` form asks for, and which of them it insists on.
 *
 * The rows are the platform's whole catalogue and nothing else — five of them, never more and never
 * fewer — so the dialog edits answers rather than a list, and there is no add or remove button. A row
 * the Start node already declares a variable for is shown but not editable: that variable owns the
 * key, so a declaration about it would do nothing, and letting the author set one would be a lie.
 *
 * The dialog works on its own copy, so cancelling discards the edits and nothing reaches the draft
 * until save. Saving writes all five keys with both answers spelled out: the projection reads an
 * unstated answer as the platform's default, so naming every one keeps the stored declaration
 * self-describing without changing what it means.
 *
 * @param props.open - Whether the dialog is showing.
 * @param props.fields - The declaration currently carried by the workflow.
 * @param props.startVariableNames - Names the Start node declares; those rows are inert.
 * @param props.hasSnapshots - Whether the workflow has a published version, or `undefined` while that
 * is still unknown. The version field needs one to have anything to offer.
 * @param props.onOpenChange - Receives the next open state.
 * @param props.onSave - Receives the committed declaration; the editor records it.
